Card Memory is a game where you have to click on a card to see what image is underneath it and try to find the matching image underneath the other cards.

- The user can see a grid with 18 cards. All the cards are faced down initially (hasBeenFlipped state set to false)
- User can click a button to start the game. When this button is clicked, a timer will start
- User can click on any card to unveil the image that is underneath it (change hasBeenFlipped state to true). The image will be displayed until the user clicks on a 2nd card
- When the User clicks on the 2nd card:
- If there is a match, the 2 cards will be eliminated from the game (leave them in the flipped state)
- If there isnâ€™t a match, the 2 cards will flip back to their original state (hasBeenFlipped set to false)
- When all the matches have been found, the User is congratulated and has the option to restart the game with a newly shuffled deck

### Current Issues

- Users can click on another card during the half second it takes for the other cards to flip over: This causes a 3rd card to stay in a flipped over state
- This application only works on desktop at the moment

### Future Features

- High Score tracking
- Random image generation
- Display all cards after a loss and highlight the ones missed
